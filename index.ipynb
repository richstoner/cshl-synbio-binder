A new virtual server will be launched on the mybinder cluster for your use with all of the tools and data pre-installed and configured. This server will last for as long as you're using it. It will shutdown after one hour of inactivity, so don't save anything important on this. \n",

    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was designed to evaluate the feasiblity of using a TXTL-CRISPRi system to characterize the impact guide source and location on respression in a simple system. Ideally, we'd like to explore the kinetics of the CRISPR/cas9 RNP binding at a very fine time scale, but that will require more method development beyond the scope of this two week course. ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general worklow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Build a model of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Design and plan the experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Write code to automate the reaction pool creation on a liquidhandler (LabCyte Echo 550!)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Run experiment(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Analyze data (this part may not make it into this notebook - running out of time for the course)\n",

    "This code models a TXTL CRISPRi system with a deGFP reporter. This model covers both plasmid-based and static concentrations of dCas9 in TXTL solution, as well as dna-based and direct RNA introduction of the guide RNA. \n",

    "### Experimental design and layout for a series of TXTL CRISPRi reactions, using a LabCyte Echo 550 liquidhandler\n",
    "\n",
    "This code takes a series of input parameters (starting concentration ranges, desired experimental conditions, reaction volumes, etc) and generates the necessary preparatory files for creating the source plate from stock solutions, the final sample list, and every discrete transfer in a format ready for the liquidhandler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code also allows us to estimate how much volume of each reagent will be used, compare between high and low dead volume source plates, and target both 96 or 384 SBS destination plates. \n",
